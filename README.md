### Hi there, I'm Brittany 👋

I'm a DevOps Engineer based in Maryland, USA. I started my career as a Web Developer and have gradually transitioned into DevOps over the past 3 years. I am passionate about maximizing efficiency in the application life cycle, tooling that improves developer productivity and quality of life, and eliminating cloud waste.

- 🌱 I'm currently learning about deploying microservices with ECS and terraform, and automating deployments with CircleCI.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to cook and am super conscious of the impact I have on the environment through the foods I eat.
